# Recipe Management System

A clean, responsive web application for adding and editing recipes. This project uses HTML, CSS, and Jinja templating to create a user-friendly recipe management interface. Perfect for those looking to build or extend a basic recipe database with CRUD functionality.

## Features

- **Dynamic Recipe Titles**: Displays either "Add Recipe" or "Edit Recipe" based on the presence of a recipe.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a seamless user experience across desktop and mobile devices.
- **Modern UI**: Uses Poppins font and a visually appealing background to create an elegant interface.
- **User Input Validation**: Required fields to ensure all necessary information is provided for each recipe.
- **Easy Customization**: Cleanly organized HTML and CSS for easy modifications.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the core structure of the web application.
- **CSS3**: For styling, layout, and responsive design.
- **Jinja Templating**: Conditional rendering of elements to show dynamic titles and other features.
- **Google Fonts**: Poppins font for a modern, stylish look.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python (if using a framework like Flask or Django).
- Familiarity with HTML, CSS, and Jinja templating.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/recipe-management-system.git
   cd recipe-management-system
   ```

2. **Set up the backend framework** (Optional, if using Flask or Django):

   - **Flask**:
     ```bash
     pip install Flask
     ```
     Create `app.py` and configure routes as shown below.

   - **Django**:
     ```bash
     pip install Django
     django-admin startproject myproject
     ```
     Place HTML files in the templates folder and set up views as needed.

3. **Run the server** (if using a framework):

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver  # For Django
   ```

4. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/add-recipe` (or the equivalent URL in Django) to access the Recipe Management System.

## Usage

1. **Add a New Recipe**: Fill in the recipe name, type, allergens, ingredients, description, and an optional image URL, then click "Add Recipe".
2. **Edit an Existing Recipe**: If a recipe object is passed, the form will display "Edit Recipe", allowing updates to existing recipe details.
